# Aim :
To demonstrate Big O Notation using nested loops in C++.

# Theroy :
Big O notation is a mathematical tool used in computer science to describe the efficiency of an algorithm, particularly its time complexity (runtime) or space complexity (memory usage), as the input size (n) grows. It provides an upper bound on the growth rate, focusing on the worst-case scenario.

In the context of C++, you use Big O to analyze your code and choose the most efficient algorithms and Standard Template Library (STL) data structures for a given task.

# Algoritm :
Start the program.

Define a function printAllPairs(arr, n).

Outer loop runs n times.

Inner loop runs n times for each outer loop.

Print pair (arr[i], arr[j]).

Total operations = n × n = n².

End program

# Connclusion
Demonstrated O(n²) complexity.
Understood how nested loops affect runtime.
Big O helps to analyze efficiency before implementation.
